# RecipeWebsite
Frontend Web Development Project Using HTML/CSS.

## Description
Below are the files for my Recipe Website. 

### mainpage.html
Click [here](https://github.com/yolanda10202/RecipeWebsite/blob/main/mainpage.html) to see the code. 

This HTML file contains the basic structure of the website. It serves as the home page for my recipe website. It includes:
* A header - contains link to style.css file and webpage name in the browser tab
* A navigation bar - contains links to each section of the webpage
* An article body - contains the two sections (Introduction and Recipe Sections)

### style.css
Click [here](https://github.com/yolanda10202/RecipeWebsite/blob/main/style.css) to see the code.

The webpage is originally designed using Figma. Original design [here](https://www.figma.com/file/2Z2NLDq0zWmKXLYW7igCJs/Cookbook-Website?node-id=0%3A1). 

This CSS file contains all code for formating the elements in mainpage.html. It includes:
* Fixed navigation bar 
* Change of style when hovering an element
* Layout of the images using grid
* Text fonts

### RecipeWebsite.pdf
See the pdf [here](https://github.com/yolanda10202/RecipeWebsite/blob/main/RecipeWebsite.pdf).

This pdf gives a more detailed explanation of my website. It includes screenshots of my webpage as well as different functions such as link and hover. 

### RecipeWebsiteDemo.mp4
Download to see the video [here](https://github.com/yolanda10202/RecipeWebsite/blob/main/RecipeWebsiteDemo.mp4).

This is a video demo of what my mainpage should look like when one opens it using any browswer. In the demo, I used Microsoft Edge. Other browsers should be compatible as well. From the video, one can see how every element (buttons, links, and navigation) on the page looks like and how they react in real time when the mouse hovers above them. 

### photos.zip
Unzip the file to access the photos that will be displayed onto the mainpage.

### Oswald.zip and Permanent_Marker.zip
Unzip the files to access the font family used in style.css. All fonts downloaded from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

## Goals
Growing up, food has always been something important in my life. I enjoy eating them, cooking them, and sharing them with my friends and family. Cooking for different people throughout the years, I have been asked to share my recipe with them. At first, I would email them a scan of my handwritten recipe, but many of them told me it's a bit hard to imagine the cooking process with words only. As a result, I tried emailing my reciping while including some pictures I took during the process. That didn't turn out too well because I'll need to keep track of several recipes at different places at the same time.
An idea came to my mind... why not make my own recipe website? I've always been interested in frontend web development, so I decided to give this idea a try.
