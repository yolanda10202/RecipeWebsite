The styling for the webpage is designed using Figma. Original design [here](https://www.figma.com/file/2Z2NLDq0zWmKXLYW7igCJs/Cookbook-Website?node-id=0%3A1). 

## Goals
Growing up, food has always been something important in my life. I enjoy eating them, cooking them, and sharing them with my friends and family. Cooking for different people throughout the years, I have been asked to share my recipe with them. At first, I would email them a scan of my handwritten recipe, but many of them told me it's a bit hard to imagine the cooking process with words only. As a result, I tried emailing my reciping while including some pictures I took during the process. That didn't turn out too well because I'll need to keep track of several recipes at different places at the same time.
An idea came to my mind... why not make my own recipe website? I've always been interested in frontend web development, so I decided to give this idea a try.
